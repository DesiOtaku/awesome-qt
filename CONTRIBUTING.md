# Guidelines
- Contribute additions or changes via MRs or Issues
- Follow categorical ordering
- Use tags (#) where necessary
- Link application names to their repository whenever possible, fall back to website in case of closed-source apps
- Add a short description of the application after it's tags, use the offical application slogan if it has one
