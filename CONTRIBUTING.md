# Guidelines
- Contribute additions or changes via MRs or Issues
- Follow categorical ordering
- Use tags (#) where necessary (Ex: #KDE)
- Link application names to their offical websites whenever possible, fall back to repositories if needed
- Add a short description of the application after it's tags, use the offical application slogan if it has one
